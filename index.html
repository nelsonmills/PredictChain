            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal is to create a safe and legal prediction market on the Solana blockchain. on this market, users will be able to make predictions about everyday phenomena like the weather and music popularity.
                Users will use Solana tokens on the developer blockchain.
                With this application, we will see whether incurred risk increases accuracy of forecasts.
                There are other applications that are somewhat similar to PredictChain, but no Solana-based prediction markets currently exist.
                We think Solana is a good currency to use for this application because it has fast and cheap transactions compared to other cryptocurrencies.

            <h3>User Experience</h3>
                <p>Once a user visits to our website, they will be given an option to link their Solana wallet. They will follow the on-screen directions until their wallet is successfully connected.
                    Once the user's wallet is connected, they will be able to see a list of events, like weather events, that they can bet on. There will be a search bar for the user to search for certain events that interest them. 
                Along with betting on existing events, users have the option to create a betting event that they and all other users can bet on. Whenever a user makes a bet, a solana smart contract is created for it. Users can buy and sell bets. 
                When the expiration date of the bet comes around, the bet is resolved, and the solana is distributed accordingly.
                Users will also have a page where they can view their portfolio of bets and their balance</p>
